# <p align='center'>**speakUP client**<p/>

This will be client for [speakUP](https://github.com/iamrahulrnair/speak-up), which is entirely designed with materai-UI components and Built on top of React with NextJS. Since [speakUP](https://github.com/iamrahulrnair/speak-up) is a microservice application, client is server side rendered and proper care should be addressed in interpod communication.

This Repository should be used along with other services of speakUP and steps to develop the application is posted in the README section of [speakUP](https://github.com/iamrahulrnair/speak-up).
